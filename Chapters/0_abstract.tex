This thesis explores the development of a prompt engineering ontology to improve the understanding, organization, and application of large language models (LLMs) across various domains. By providing a structured representation of prompting techniques and their relationships with LLMs, the ontology serves as a valuable resource for guiding users in effectively interacting with these advanced systems. The research adopts a systematic approach to ontology development, following the LOT (Linked Open Terms) methodology. Special attention is given to ontology evaluation and publication. The prompt engineering ontology is design to provide support to a wide range of users, including researchers, developers, educators, and content creators. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential for automated ontology population using advanced AI tools, significantly reducing the manual effort required to maintain and expand the ontology over time. This work makes a significant contribution to the growing field of prompt engineering and demonstrates the value of structured knowledge representation in enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs.
